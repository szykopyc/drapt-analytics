## Planned Summer 2025 Revamp

The project is currently paused for academic commitments and quant preparation. Development will resume in **Summer 2025** with a full architectural overhaul and feature expansion, including:

### **Frontend**
- Migration to a **dynamic JavaScript frontend** using **React**
- Interactive, responsive dashboards for portfolio input and visualization
- Real-time data rendering using component-driven architecture
- Integration of charting libraries (e.g., Recharts, Plotly.js) for analytics display

### **Backend**
- Transition from Flask to **FastAPI** for improved performance and async capabilities
- Modularized portfolio analysis functions for better maintainability
- RESTful API endpoints for real-time interaction with the frontend
- Nightly **cron jobs** to perform batch analytics and reduce peak load

### **Performance + UX**
- **Caching of portfolio analysis** results to enhance response times
- More efficient portfolio data handling and preprocessing
- Cleaner user authentication flow using **JWT tokens**
